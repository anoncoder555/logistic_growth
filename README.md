## Reproducible Research Assingment: Version Control and R

### Q1: Annotate the **README.md** file in your `logistic_growth` repo with more detailed information about the analysis. Add a section on the results and include the estimates for $N_0$, $r$ and $K$ (mention which *.csv file you used).

**Introduction**

This analysis uses data from the bacteria *Escherichia coli* grown in a test tube with 900 μl of growth media and 100 μl of bacterial suspension. In my analysis I used data from the experiment.csv file. This data was used to estimate the intial population size ($N_0$), growth rate ($r$) and carrying capacity ($K$).

**Methods** 

Section One:

consistent with logistic growth. The logistic growth of bacteria has three main phases: 

Section Two:

Section Three:

**Results**

### Q2 Use your estimates of $N_0$ and $r$ to calculate the population size at $t$ = 4980 min, assuming that the population grows exponentially. How does it compare to the population size predicted under logistic growth? 

### Q3 Add an R script to your repository that makes a graph comparing the exponential and logistic growth curves (using the same parameter estimates you found). Upload this graph to your repo and include it in the **README.md** file so it can be viewed in the repo homepage.
